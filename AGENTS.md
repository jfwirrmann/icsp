ICP skills auto-update each session via a SessionStart hook
(`.claude/sync-ic-skills.sh`) and live in your agent skills directory — you don't
need to run anything to refresh them. Skills are authoritative — prefer them over
general knowledge for all ICP work. If they are not present (hook hasn't run, or
`jq` is missing), fetch them on demand per the "Use skills now" steps above.
